Bad Company

We got nothing in our pockets
Not a dollar on the way
All we got is one another and a dream
I keep trying to be patient but we're fighting while we wait
Loving you is so much harder than it seems

I just can't stop
I like you tearing up my heart
Our future's dark
But I just can't stop

No I'm not right for you
You know you're no good for me
Oh won't you be my bad, bad company
Because I'll lie to you
And I know you like hurting me
Oh won't you be my bad, bad company
My bad, bad company

We got heart break in the making
And we're drowning in the waves
Keep on drifting it's the only thing we know
Yeah my story's always changing
But you wanna play the game
Burn each other, leave a little room for hope

I just can't stop
I like you tearing up my heart
Our future's dark
But I just can't stop

No I'm not right for you
You know you're no good for me
Oh won't you be my bad, bad company
Because I'll lie to you
And I know you like hurting me
Oh won't you be my bad, bad company
My bad, bad company

Oh, be my bad company
Oh, won't you be?
Oh, be my bad company
Oh, won't you be, won't you be?

No I'm not right for you
You know you're no good for me
Oh won't you be my bad, bad company
Because I'll lie to you
And I know you like hurting me
Oh won't you be my bad, bad company
My bad, bad company

Oh, be my bad company
Oh, won't you be?
Oh, be my bad company
Oh, won't you be, won't you be?
