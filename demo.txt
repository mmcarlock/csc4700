What is your favorite movie?
  I need to break this down into favorite movie by category. But to summarize, I will only list three.
  A Cinderella Story is my all time favorite movie because it contains so much childhood nostalgia, and Chad Michael Murray was in his prime when filming this movie. The amount of one liners and witty sarcastic humor is amazing. I can watch this movie over and over and never get bored of it.
  My favorite Disney movie is Tangled because I am basically Rapunzel. I only need a little chameleon friend.
  My favorite superhero movie is Spider-Man: Homecoming. I completely love Tom Holland as Peter Parker and Spider-Man. I could rant on for hours why I love this movie, but I'm going to stop right now.

If you could go anywhere in the world for vacation, where would it be?
  I have a few destinations I love. New York City is my favorite city in the US. I could never get bored there because I love exploring it. Even though I lived there for a summer, I did not get sick of it. I only grew to hate Times Square because of all the tourists.
  Outside of the US, I would love to go back to London and actually explore more. I was only there for a weekend to go to a concert, and that was not nearly enough time.
  I also love going to San Diego. I haven't been there in a long time, but it holds a special place in my heart becuase my dad was stationed there for a bit. Also, I went there for the first time before my dad was sent on a deployment to Iraq.

If you could have any super power, what would it be (and why that power)?
  I want the ability to fill things. Wallet is empty? Fill it with money. Beverage is empty? Fill it with your poison of choice. Someone you don't like walks past you? Fill thier bladder up so they have to run to the bathroom.
  It sounds like a copout, but it would be a really cool power.
